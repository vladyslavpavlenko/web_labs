|        | C1   | **MVC.** Develop a system using the MVC approach (in a model of 3+ entities with relationships, one of the fields must be of the file (link) type + implement CRUD).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|        | С2   | **Cloud.** Post the project on the Internet using a CSP (Azure or other cloud storage: Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                        |
|        | C3   | **CI/CD.** Set up automatic project deployment in the cloud. Changes to the project should be automatically deployed after the main branch is updated in the version control system. GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Azure WebApp Deployment, and others can be used as a platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|        | C4   | **Containerization.** Containerize the project into a Docker image and use it to deploy the project in a container orchestration environment (Docker Compose, Kubernetes). Deployment can be done locally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|        | C5   | **REST API.** Add to the project the implementation of CRUD functions via JSON (without classic View: GET requests return a set of JSON objects, POST requests – with a JSON body with changes – return "OK"/"Error"), that is, to duplicate the functionality from the **C1** task in the form of a REST API + demonstrate the work using CURL/PostMan/etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|        | QA1  | **Automated Web API Testing.** Set up a Web API testing environment for a **C5** project using the capabilities of Postman, SOAP UI, or similar software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|        | C6   | **Bootstrap (Landing Page).** Develop a Landing-page for the objects of the subject area using Bootstrap (all information is on one page with scroll, contacts are constantly on the screen; for example, if there are products in the database, you need to develop a Landing Page for each product in the database with a photo, description and user-friendly presentation - separately, that is, improve the "Details" page in MVC for this (selected) entity).                                                                                                   |
|        | C7   | **SEO Page Optimization.** Optimize the page with **C6** for display in search engines. Evaluate the site using free SEO audit services (for example, Seobility).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|        | QA2  | **E2E testing.** Develop End2End tests for a web application with **C1**, **C7**, **F2**, **C12**, or **F5**. Evaluate the coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|        | B1   | **Pagination API.** Add page-by-page data output for **C5**. Implement skip/limit/nextLink. You can implement the OData protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|        | C8   | **Third-Party APIs Integration.** Use a third-party API. For example, with MapBox/OpenStreetMap/Google/... Map service to display objects (entities from the project model) on the map (all at the same time). _Integration is not just about putting a point on the map!, there must be either dynamics or many points that are filtered._                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|        | F1   | **Statistics Visualization.** Add (statistical) mini-charts / graphs to the map / integrate with Chart (JS) / display info using d3 / other similar library (JS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|        | B2   | **Third-Party APIs Integration (2).** Integrate interaction with another API: Privat24 / WebHooks: Telegram (Bot) / Google Drive / ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|        | B3   | **Enterprise Systems Integration.** Integrate interaction with an ERP or CRM system (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|        | C9   | **Analytics Services Integration**. Azure Log Analytics, Azure App Insights (custom event), Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|        | F2   | **JavaScript + JQuery (+AJAX).** Autocomplete: Replace drop-down elements in MVC project forms with an autocomplete selector (using JQuery UI Autocomplete, SELECT2, or another element). It should load matching elements from the backend for the dropdown list, containing words entered in the `<input>` field. It should be capable of handling a large number of options (preferably millions+), starting from 3 characters with a slight delay after typing into this field (these parameters are usually configurable in the autocomplete selector settings). |
|        | B4   | **Search.** Use ElasticSearch/Lucene/Azure Search (Cognitive Services) for the API search in the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|        | C10  | **Connectivity.
